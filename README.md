## Run with Vagrant
I recommend this way, cause if you don't like it, you didn't mess up your system.

```sh
vagrant up
```

## Run with Docker
May you prefer Dockern rather then Vagrant, then I recommend this way. Because if you don't like it, you didn't mess up your system.

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/backstopjs-example --name backstopjs-example-container vergissberlin/backstopjs-example bash
```


## Installation without Vagrant and Docker
If you don't wanna use Vagrant, you have to install the dependencies on your own. Please install _phantomjs_ and the node packages like that:

```sh
sudo npm i backstopjs phantomjs slimerjs -g
cd backstop-example && npm i
```
